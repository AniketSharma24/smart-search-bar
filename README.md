## Description
Welcome to the SmartSearch Bar! SmartSearch is an innovative project designed to assist frontend developers and software engineers in preparing for machine coding rounds. It introduces an intelligent auto-suggest search bar that dynamically offers suggestions as users type. Leveraging debouncing techniques for optimal performance and powered by React and Redux, SmartSearch intelligently caches previous search results, significantly reducing duplicate API calls and enhancing user experience.

## Note
- As I am using Youtube Suggestion API it requires API key. Make sure you generate your own API key.
