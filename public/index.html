      frontend developers and software engineers prepare for machine coding
      rounds by showcasing an auto-suggest search bar that dynamically
      provides suggestions as users type. Leveraging debouncing for optimal
      performance, and powered by React and Redux, it intelligently caches
      previous search results to minimize duplicate API calls." />
